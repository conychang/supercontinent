All pads here are non-pitched 

pads have 5 versions each, varying in duration, filtering, and behaviour
Every 4/4 bar in 120 bpm = 2 seconds. 4 bars 8 seconds, so this will be the basis
0 = 8 seconds
1 = 8 seconds darkened
2 = 16 seconds
3 = 16 seconds darkened
4 = 24 seconds swelling in volume

5-9 would be a different sound
10-14, 15-19 etc.
